    <p>I'm currently a PhD student in Grenoble, France who's has been given the task of understanding what neuroscientists mean by "criticality" and how we might exploit it for faster physics-based ASICs of the spintronic variety in ML applications and bring about the sci-fi end times or whatever.</p>

    <p>My background is in Mathematics with a BSc from the Open University and two years of MSc Mathematics @ Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I then did a few years as a paperweight in the cybersecurity industry before teaching myself how to make chips online, going back to get a second MSc in Embedded AI @ Maynooth University and undertaking this PhD.</p>

    <p>If you feel the need to reach out - you can find me on LinkedIn and my email's out there somewhere!</p>
