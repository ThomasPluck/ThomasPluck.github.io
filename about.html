    <p>I'm currently studying the dynamics of neural networks by studying/proposing neuromorphic architectures. This blog is the culmination of my work following the maxim "if it's makes sense in silicon, it makes sense in software".</p>

    <p>My background is in Mathematics with a BSc from the Open University and two years of MSc Mathematics @ Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I then did a few years as a paperweight in the cybersecurity industry before teaching myself how to make chips online, going back to get a second MSc in Embedded AI @ Maynooth University and undertaking this PhD.</p>

    <p>If you feel the need to reach out - you can find me on LinkedIn and my email's out there somewhere!</p>
