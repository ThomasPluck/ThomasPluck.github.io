I'm Thomas Pluck, a passionate FOSS Silicon Chip Design enthusiast with a background in mathematics. My goal is to lower the barrier of entry to free and open-source chip design, making it accessible to everyone and fostering innovation in the field.

On my blog, I share my journey and insights into the world of FOSS chip design, offering valuable tutorials and updates on my latest projects. I invite you to join me on my mission to democratize silicon chip design and be a part of my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZeroToASIC">#ZeroToASIC</a> journey in the open-source hardware revolution.
